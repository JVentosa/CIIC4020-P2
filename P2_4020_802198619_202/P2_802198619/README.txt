CIIC4020 - 086/050L

Hello! Welcome to my 2nd project for the course CIIC4020.

This project consisted of the use of Linked Lists with Nodes, and how they can be used as either Simply LLists, or 
Double Llist! Using the tester for this project, I have made it so the tester runs all three different LList, and
print them at the same time.

In order to run this, you will need to open the command prompt / terminal of your computer and
 put in the following line

"cd ...\P2_4020_802198619_202\P2_802198619"
	
Afterwards, the following command must be written so all of the test cases can appear

java -classpath ./bin tester/IndexListTester

This will run the tester and print out all 3 LList and their respective answers. 
The first one to be printed is the SLList, following it the SLFLList and finally the DLDHDTList

You may get each one and compare SLList test cases with either SLFLList or DLDHDTList, 
either manually or by using a text comparator website such as: https://text-compare.com This will show whether there
are any differences in the numbers or text throughout the document.

Done! All numbers should come out in order as each other.


For simple cases, these are the steps in order to run in the command prompt again.

1: "cd ...\P2_4020_802198619_202\P2_802198619"
2: java -classpath ./bin tester/IndexListTester

3: Done! Check all the numbers.

You can now run all test cases and run the full code, congrats!
